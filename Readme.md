# AT21CS11 EEPROM Emulation on Puya PY32F0xx

This repository contains an **AT21CS11 EEPROM emulator over SWI (Single-Wire Interface)** implemented on the **Puya PY32F0xx** Cortex-M0+ microcontroller using **LL (Low Layer)** drivers.

It uses precise timing and GPIO polling to emulate the behavior of the original IC, responding to commands like manufacturer ID query and memory access. The internal EEPROM buffer persists across resets by placing it in a dedicated flash section that isn't erased during firmware updates.

🔗 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jjsch-dev/at21cs11-eeprom-emulator)

The project emulates basic commands like:
- EEPROM read/write
- Manufacturer ID query
- Start/stop condition detection for host communication
- ACK/NACK handling
- Bit-level timing control via polling and manual GPIO toggling

All global state transitions are handled in the main loop with precise µs-level timing to mimic the behavior of the original IC.

### 3. pyOCD (for flashing and debugging via SWD)

We use [pyOCD](https://pyocd.io/) to program the PY32F0xx microcontroller over SWD using an ST-Link or CMSIS-DAP programmer.

### 🧰 Install pyOCD Locally:

1. **Create** a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash

2. **Install** pyOCD in the virtual environment :
   ```bash
   pip install -U pyocd
   ```
---

### 4. Device Support for PY32F0xx
**pyOCD** does not natively support Puya PY32 MCUs, so we must provide a device pack file .

### 📦 Add PY32F0xx Support

1. **Download** the device family pack:

- From: [Keil Device Family Pack for PY32F0xx](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/py32f0xx_dfp-puya/versions/)
- File used in this project: **Puya.PY32F0xx_DFP.1.1.0.pack**

2. **Place** it in the `toolchain/pyocd/` folder:
   ```bash
   cp Puya.PY32F0xx_DFP.1.1.0.pack toolchain/pyocd/
   ```
   
3. **Create** a pyocd.yaml configuration file in your project root:
   ```ymal
   pack:
     - ./toolchain/pyocd/Puya.PY32F0xx_DFP.1.1.0.pack 
   ```

4. **Use** the config when flashing :
   ```bash
   # Load firmware
   pyocd load ./swi_eeprom.hex -t py32f002ax5 --config ./pyocd.yaml

   # Erase chip
   pyocd erase --chip -t py32f002ax5 --config ./pyocd.yaml
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure the target name (py32f002ax5) matches your specific MCU variant.

---

### 5. Optional: Programmer Hardware

To flash and debug the PY32F0xx microcontroller, an **SWD-compatible programmer** is required. The following image shows the ST-Link V2 programmer connected to the target board via a 10-pin connector.

![St-link](images/st-link-v2.png)

✅ **ST-Link V2 clone** (widely available and low-cost)  

Other supported options:
- CMSIS-DAP compatible debugger
- Black Magic Probe (alternative)

Ensure the following connections are made between the programmer and the PY32 MCU:

| Programmer Pin | Target MCU (PY32F0xx) |
|----------------|----------------------|
| SWCLK          | PA14                 |
| SWDIO          | PA13                 |
| GND            | GND                  |
| 3.3V (optional) | 3.3V               |

> [!NOTE]
> Some clones may require firmware updates to work reliably with non-STM32 devices like the Puya PY32 series.

## 📝 SWI Protocol Overview

The **AT21CS01/11 EEPROM device** operates as a slave device using a **single-wire digital serial interface (SWI)** to communicate with a host controller. The protocol is designed for simplicity and efficiency, utilizing an 8-bit data structure where power is provided via the SI/O pin.

During communication, the state of the SI/O pin during specific time intervals determines the interpretation of data. Each bit frame transmits one data bit, and after eight bits (one byte), the receiving device must respond with either an **Acknowledge (ACK)** or **No Acknowledge (NACK)** response bit during a ninth bit window.

---

### 📊 Types of Data Transmitted Over the SI/O Line

The following types of data are transmitted over the single-wire interface:

1. **Reset and Discovery Response**
   - Used by the master to reset the device and perform a general bus call to determine if any devices are present on the bus.
   - **Waveform**: ![Figure 4-1: Reset and Discovery Response Waveform](images/figure_4-1.png)

2. **Logic ‘0’ or Acknowledge (ACK)**
   - Indicates a logic '0' or an ACK response.
   - **Waveform**: ![Figure 4-2: Logic ‘0’ Input Condition Waveform](images/figure_4-2.png)

3. **Logic ‘1’ or No Acknowledge (NACK)**
   - Indicates a logic '1' or a NACK response.
   - **Waveform**: ![Figure 4-3: Logic ‘1’ Input Condition Waveform](images/figure_4-3.png)

4. **Start Condition**
   - Marks the beginning of a command sequence.
   - **Waveform**: ![Figure 4-4: Start Condition Waveform](images/figure_4-4.png)

5. **Stop Condition**
   - Marks the end of a command sequence.
   - **Waveform**: ![Figure 4-5: Stop Condition Waveform](images/figure_4-5.png)

### ✅ Why This MCU Is Ideal for EEPROM Emulation

- **Accurate Bit-Bang Timing**:  
  The dual 16-bit timers and deterministic Cortex-M0+ instruction timing allow sub-microsecond delays required by the AT21CS11 protocol.

- **Open-Drain GPIO Support**:  
  Dynamic switching between input (high impedance) and output modes with internal pull-ups matches the single-wire, open-drain requirements of SWI communication.

- **Sufficient Flash & RAM**:  
  With 20 KB Flash and 3 KB SRAM, the chip comfortably supports:
  - Bit-banged SWI logic
  - Timer-based edge detection
  - Optional debug logging
  - Persistent memory emulation in flash

- **Robust Communication Peripherals**:  
  Built-in USART, SPI, and I²C are useful for debugging or future expansions (e.g., capturing external EEPROM signals).

- **Cost-Effective & Compact**:  
  At under $0.10 in volume and housed in a small SOP-8 package, it’s ideal for prototyping or high-volume deployments.

By leveraging its precise timers, flexible GPIO, and ample memory, the PY32F002AL15S6TU becomes a highly capable platform for emulating an AT21CS11 EEPROM entirely in software.

### 📑 Known Limitations

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

This implementation has several limitations that are important to understand before using or extending the project:

- ❗ **Polling-based design** – Polling is used instead of IRQ-based edge detection in timing-critical sections.  
  This avoids the latency and stack overhead associated with interrupt handling, ensuring fast response to host signals.  
  However, the time consumed by processing logic (approx **1.3 µs**) leaves little room to add more features or complex logic.  
  Using a faster CPU like the **[PY32L020](docs/PY32L020_Datasheet_V1.0.pdf)** running at **48 MHz** could improve performance,  
  though note that **Flash access at 48 MHz adds a wait state**, so clock configuration must be optimized accordingly.
  
- ❗ **Start Condition Detection Strategy** – Start condition detection relies on a timer interrupt (TIM1 CC2), which triggers if no edge is detected within `TIMEOUT_START_US`.  
  For simplicity and to avoid extra checks during time-critical polling, the timer is reset on *every* edge detection without verifying the level of the SWI line.  
  This may result in less accurate start condition handling if the host's timing deviates from expectations.

- ❗ **EEPROM write command not implemented** – While read operations work, the EEPROM write command is not yet supported.  
  This limits full bidirectional communication with the host until implemented.

- ❗ **Timing sensitivity and synchronization** – Host communication must follow expected bit timing precisely.  
  The current design sends logic '0' on the falling edge to reduce response delay. However, this causes the bit counter to advance before the host’s ACK/NACK is received.  
  If not handled properly, this can lead to misalignment with the host and data errors during transmission.

- ❗ **Chip Enable Signal Handling** – An external interrupt (`EXTI0_1_IRQHandler`) is used to detect when the `CHIP_ENABLE_PIN` goes high, reducing CPU usage by avoiding constant polling.  
  When the host re-enables the chip (pin goes low), execution resumes from wherever the loop was paused.  
  This means the emulator may resume operation mid-bit-time with outdated state variables (e.g., `swi_state`, `bit_count`, etc.), leading to potential synchronization issues.
